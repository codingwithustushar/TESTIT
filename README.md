# TESTIT


# OBJECTIVE:
The main objective of this website is to make full working website where any user can easily access the recipie and can see the ingredients.

# WORKING 
In this I have used the API from this website (https://www.themealdb.com) and the used two differet APIs for fetching,the one API is for random meal (https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php) through which we are fetching the name of the meal,category,ingredients and the images of meal and after every refreshing the page the meal gets changed. The second API is for searched meal (www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Seafood) and through this we can see the name of the meal and the images of the meal.
